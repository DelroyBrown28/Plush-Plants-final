# Plush-Plants
My First Static Milestone Project - User-Centric Frontend Development

This is a fun fictional plant based website that sells "..elegant and sleek" looking plants. Here you can browse through dozens of wild and exotic plants from all over the world. You can also sign up to the monthly newsletter for updates on products and deals, or leave a message with your contact details for the team.

## UX

The Plush Plant website is aimed at plant enthusiasts with deep pockets. The site is made to be straight forward and to the point for buying exotic wild plants.

### Mockups/Project skeleton

Here you can see the design for the Plush Plants website, including early landing page ideas. The project was first designed in Adobe XD.

### Features

I went for a green theme throughtout with bit of Yellow added here and there. I've placed buttons and links in appropriate places for ase of use.

#### Landing page

The lading page is a simple design with a bold blurb explaining the sites intent. There are buttons immediately directing you to the sign up form and store for ease of use.

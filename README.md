# Plush-Plants
My First Static Milestone Project - User-Centric Frontend Development

This is a fun fictional plant based website that sells "..elegant and sleek" looking plants. Here you can browse through dozens of wild and exotic plants from all over the world. You can also sign up to the monthly newsletter for updates on products and deals, or leave a message with your contact details for the team.

## UX

The Plush Plant website is aimed at plant enthusiasts with deep pockets. The site is made to be straight forward and to the point for buying exotic wild plants.

### Mockups/Project skeleton

Here you can see the design for the Plush Plants website, including early landing page ideas. The project was first designed in Adobe XD.

### Features

I went for a green theme throughtout with bit of Yellow added here and there. I've placed buttons and links in appropriate places for ase of use.

#### Landing page

The lading page is a simple design with a bold blurb explaining the sites intent. There are buttons immediately directing you to the sign up form and store for ease of use. There are links to social media sites at the bottom of the page and another link at the top of the page to contact the team more directly.

#### Store Page

The store page starts with a large bold title with a small sign up button underneath, again prompting the customer to sign up. A small 'Home' button at the top left will take you back to the landing page. Scrolling down you will see more links to social media sites before coming to the plants themselves.

The plant names used are all Latin for a more "fancy" effect. The prices are all very high to keep along with the the theme of "plush plants" and "...elegant and sleek". Clicking the basket icon will turn it yellow, symbolising the product has been added to the basket.

There is a sign up form at the bottom of the screen tempting the customer with a 15% saving on your first order. clicking into the input field will cause the field to expand for typing longer email addresses, when theemial is entered, click "Sign up" to reveal a "Thank you!" message made using the 'onclick' Javascript function.

#### Contact/Sign Up Page

Sticking with the green theme, the contact page is split in to 2 sides, 1 side features the form to fill out with your name, last name and email address, and also an expanding box to leave a message for the team. Clicking submit will reveal a message saying "Sent!" letting the user know the message has been sent. On the left, a small message reading "Say hi. Or sign up below" has a small bouncing arrow underneath which when clicked will take you down to the customer sign up form.

#### Sign Up Page

The sign up page does the opposite of the contact page with the form on the left and a message reading "Sign up. Save 15% on your first order when you sign up" on the right. You can sign up with your emaail address, first and last name and a password that you willhae to enter twice to complete the form, a small radio button is featured to agree to the terms of service. The terms of service link will take you to a wikipedia article. You can then click "sign up" to reveal a message saying "Thanks!"

### Feautres left to implement

I would ike to have the shopping baskets add to a sidebar checkout box, I understand this is something I will learn as I progress through the course and would like to implement this in the future. I would also like to have the ability to receive real messages through the 'Contact Us' page message box. Thorugh tons of Googling I learnt that this can be done with Javascript but I still feel I need to progress through the course more for a better understanding before adding this feature.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/)
  - Small amount of Javascript used for the 'onclick' function on buttons.
